# Quiz 3: GeoJson and TopoJson

For this home assignment, you will need to look for a shapefile (polygon) and convert it to geojson and topojson. It would be great if this data can be used for your final project. For this assignment, you need to:

[1] Convert the raw geospatial data as a geojson;

[2] Simplify this geojson as a new geojson data; and

[3] Convert the simplified geojson as a typojson.

In the readme.md file of this repo, please briefly introduce this data, and also make a table to compare the data size of these three (geo/topo)-json files. for example:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>size(kb)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>xxx.geojson</td>
<td>10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>xxx_simplifed.geojson</td>
<td>1,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>xxx.topojson</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In the assets folder of this repo, please upload the three json files.  So, the structure of this repository should be: 


```terminal
[your_repository_name]
    │readme.md
    ├─assets
    │      XXX.geojson
    │      XXX_simplified.geojson
    │      XXX.topojson
```

Please only submit the url of this repository to canvas.
