# Quiz 4: D3 and JQuery Selectors

In this quize, you are expected to use both `d3` and `jquery` to select the following elements from [index.html](index.html):

* [1] all the `<p>` elements.
* [2] the first `<div>` element.
* [3] any elements contains the content/text `"US"`.
* [4] the last `strong` elements.
* [5] any element, whose `id` is `"us-chart"`.
* [6] all elements, whose class are `"clearfix"`.
* [7] any `<a>` element under a `<p>` element.

For each item, you are asked to use both `d3` and `jquery` to select. For example, to select all the `<a>` elements from the index.html, we can use either `d3.selectAll("a")` or `$("a")`

>***Note:*** You can use the console of Chrome Inspector to evaluate whether the selectors are correct or not.
