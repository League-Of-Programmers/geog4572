In this lab, you are expected to make a geovisualization, which can be either storymap or coordinated view. Before you make your own geoviz, please please go over and start with emulate the  templates below.

- [Storymap Tutorial](storymap/readme.md), [Example 1](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/coordinated/index.html), [Example 2](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/coordinated/helloworld.html)

- [Coordianted View Tutorial](coordinated/readme.md), [Example](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/coordinated/index.html)


To help you choose a type of geovisualization to work on, we encouarge

- students to work on a geovisualization which is as the same type as the final project.

- Students who have already taken GEOG 371 (Web Mapping) to work on a coordinated view.

However, students can freely pick up either type of geoviz they feel interested in.

### Below  is the grading criteria:
