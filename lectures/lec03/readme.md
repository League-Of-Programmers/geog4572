## Project ideas offered by the Instructor and co-advisors ##


**[1] Visualizing emotional changes during Hurricane Harvey**

The geoviz lab has collected a large datset of social media data (twitter, instagram) during Hurricane Harvey. This data set contains well-structured tweets, instagram photos, and individual life paths (interpreted by geo-tagged content). In this term, we are thinking of studying how people emotionally response to this natural disaster, evacuation as well as other relevant events using this data set. By detecting the facial expression of the people who are in the nstagram photos, we can study the collective and individual emotional changes before, during and after the hurracane. Also, a correlation between the collective emotion and social-economic varaibles can be done to further understand the causations of the emotional changes.

**[2] Geovisualizing Public Attitudes on Climate Change During 2012-2017 Through Twitter**

Climate change refers to the abnormal changes of regional or global weather patterns. It poses a serious threat to the economics of human communities and the environment of planet earth. Many researchers have demonstrated that climate change is happening from observations of sea-level rise, temperature changes, and extreme weather events (NASA, 2018). Therefore, public awareness and attitudes of the existence of climate change is an issue with significant societal and political implications (Kirilenko et al. 2015). 
Traditionally, data describing public attitude towards critical global themes such as climate change are often collected through field, telephone, or online surveys, which are usually very time-consuming and expensive. Social media, as a type of Big Data, provides an innovative approach to observe public attitudes towards certain topics in real-time. However, training a reliable classifier to enable computers to understand social media data, e.g. Tweet, is still a challenging task. 

Deep Learning has great potential in semantic analysis. It enables computers to answer critical questions, such as whether one tweet/article believes climate change is happening or not. By analyzing Twitter discussion on ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’ during 2012-2017, this research examines the utility of one popular Deep Learning algorithm, deep neural network, in identifying climate change deniers on Twitter, investigates the spatial-temporal patterns of public attitude towards climate change on Twitter at multiple administrative levels, in addition to mining the underlying geographical and social factors. A WebGIS platform will be developed for data visualization and exploration, as well as information sharing.

**[3] Geovisualization of Soil Health for Climate Resilience using social media**

Preserving soil resources and enhancing soil health is critical to reducing agricultural systems’ social and ecological vulnerability, particularly in the context of more frequent extreme and variable weather associated with climate change. Managing farms, forests and rangelands for improved soil health has been seen as a way to meet dual goals of productivity and sustainability. Soil health may become more important in the era of climate change because greater extremes in the weather may cause greater erosion as well as losses in organic matter, a key building block for soil health. The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) defines soil health as “the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans” so that they are “sustainable for future generations”. In the Northwest, and across the U.S., despite the importance of soil health, many farmers still haven’t adopted practices that would improve their soil health (such as no-till farming, crop diversification, cover crops and crop/livestock integration). As part of a Social Ecological Synthesis Center funded [project](https://www.sesync.org/project/propose-a-pursuit/soil-as-a-social-ecological-feedback-mapping-the-social-and-ecological) (SESYNC) and the USDA Climate Hubs, there is interest in learning more about how land managers are talking about soil health on social media across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Visualizing the types of conversation and their spatial extent and distribution using a Story Map framework would be of immense interest and could eventually be integrated into a larger Story Map project that is being designed as part of this SESYNC project that is examining the role of soil as a social-ecological feedback at multiple spatial and human institutional scales.
