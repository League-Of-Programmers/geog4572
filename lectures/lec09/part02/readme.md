`dc.js` is a JavaScript Library that allow you to develop graphs/charts, and highly interactive Dashboards. `dc.js` builds on `d3.js` and use `d3.js` to render charts in CSS friendly SVG format. By using this library you will be able to develop bar chart (histogram), pie chart, row chart, line chart, bubble chart, geo choropleth chart, and others. You can link the charts to each other to make a well connected charting interface for your work.

This JavaScript library is really a powerful tool for data visualization and analysis on the web. Here in this tutorial we'll try to cover some basics of `dc.js` that will help you to move on with `dc.js`.

##### Dependency

dc.js didn't works alone, it require `crossfilter.js` and `d3.js` to work.

[crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki) is also a JavaScript library released by Square, allow you to explore large multidimensional datasets. It aggregates and filter raw data extremely fast (<30ms). It doesn't have its own user interface, so it combine to work with `d3.js` and Google Visualization API. Itâ€™s really easy to get your raw data into `crossfilter.js` by using JSON data format.

[D3](https://d3js.org/) also known as Data-Driven Documents or `d3.js`, a JavaScript Library for data visualization, allow you to present raw data into a more visual form using SVG, Canvas and HTML5 and CSS standards. It is the more powerful library of JavaScript as to visualize data in graphical format as compared to above mentioned.

So, these two libraries are our helper libraries in using DC library. Let's move to work.



Copy these four files and paste in your project folder and link these files into your project file.

```
<script  src="d3.js"></script>
<script  src="crossfilter.js"></script>
<script  src="dc.js"></script>
```

Now, we are able to work with dc.js, So, lets start.

##### Build Charts/Graphs

Once you've setup environment to work with `dc.js` open your project files start building charts with us. First we'll build Bar Chart, follow us.

###### Bar Chart

To develop any chart you need some raw data, for which you want to build a chart. it should be in JSON format. Here in the following example we copy the JSON data from crosfilter.js. You can use this or your own data to move with the example.

```
<html lang="EN">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>DC template</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dc.css" />
      <script type="text/javascript" src="d3.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="crossfilter.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="dc.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Bart Chart By Total Payment</h1>
        <div id="barChart"></div>

        <script type="text/javascript">

               // JSON data from crossfilter.js
          var paymentsRecord = [
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:17:54Z", quantity: 2, total: 190, tip: 100, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:20:19Z", quantity: 2, total: 190, tip: 100, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:28:54Z", quantity: 1, total: 300, tip: 200, type: "visa"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:30:43Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:48:46Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:53:41Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:54:06Z", quantity: 1, total: 100, tip: 0, type: "cash"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T16:58:03Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T17:07:21Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T17:22:59Z", quantity: 2, total: 90, tip: 0, type: "tab"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T17:25:45Z", quantity: 2, total: 200, tip: 0, type: "cash"},
          {date: "2011-11-14T17:29:52Z", quantity: 1, total: 200, tip: 100, type: "visa"}
        ];

        </script>

    </body>
</html>
```

Take the raw data in JSON format paste it in your project file as above in the code.

After that feed this data to crossfilter object to process this data.

`var facts = crossfilter(paymentsRecord);` we named it as facts, each row in JSON data called fact.

You can also check this data in the console writing this line `console.log(facts);`

Now we'll have to create a dimension of our data, It means, if you want to know how many total payments you've made, for this we need to create a dimension. You can create any dimension of your data. For this write the code, here is the dimension by total.

```
var dimensionByTotal = facts.dimension(function (d){ return d.total;});
```

Then we grouped our data with the help of dimension we just created. It means if you want to know how many payments are done of the each amount (how many $100

payments). As you can see in our data there are six $90 payment and two $200 and so on. To group our data we'll write the code.

```
var groupByTotal = dimensionByTotal.group(function(d){ return Math.floor(d/100)*100; });
```

Here "dimensionByTotal " is the variable we just created to create dimension.

All we have done our data related stuff, now we will move to build a bar chart. For this create an object of bar chart.

```
var barChart = dc.barChart("#chart")
```

`#barChart` is the ID of the `div` in which we want to show our data.

```
var barChart = dc.barChart('#barChart')
                    .width(1024) // width of the chart 
                    .height(200) // height of the chart
                    .dimension(dimensionByTotal) // dimension we create above passed as parameter
                    .group(groupByTotal) // group we created above passed as parameter to barChart method
                    .x(d3.scale.linear().domain([0,400])) // created x-axis scales
                    .xUnits(dc.units.fp.precision(100)); // it defines the units of x-axis
                    //.x(d3.scale.ordinal())
                    //.xUnits(dc.units.ordinal);
            barChart.yAxis().ticks(5);
            barChart.xAxis().ticks(4);

            dc.renderAll();
```

###### Ordinal-Bar Chart

Bar charts that display the data that are classified into nominal or ordinal categories, such as in our raw data if we want to classified our data by Type, there are three types of data in our raw data, visa, tab, cash. If we develop a bar chart on type dimension the bar chart is called Odinal-Bar Chart.

To create ordinal bar chart just replace this code with specific methods in the code.

Total dimention with Type Dimension

`var dimensionByType = facts.dimension(function (d){ return d.type;});`

and Dimension Group with this new code

`var groupByType = dimensionByType.group().reduceCount(function(d){ return d.type; });` reduceCount function counts the total number of records.

Then change the dimension and group variable from barCharts methods.

`.dimension(dimensionByType)`

`.group(groupByType)`

Change the x-axis scale and units to ordinal

`.x(d3.scale.ordinal())`

`.xUnits(dc.units.ordinal)`

Thats it, you see how it is easy to create charts with dc.js
