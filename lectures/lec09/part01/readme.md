## Create SVG Elements using D3

We had briefly introduced Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in our web standards chapter. In this chapter, we will learn about creating SVG elements using D3.

SVG provides different shapes like lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses etc. Hence, designing visualizations with SVG gives you more flexibility and power in what you can achieve.

**What is SVG?**

- SVG is an image that is text-based.
- SVG is similar in structure to HTML
- SVG sits in the DOM
- SVG properties can be specified as attributes
- SVG should have absolute positions relative to the origin (0, 0)

The following example demonstrates a rectangle in SVG.

```svg
<svg width="500" height="500">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="200" height="200"></rect>
</svg>
```
