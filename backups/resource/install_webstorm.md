This course adopts WebStorm to make geovisualization. In Digital Earth Lab, every computer has installed WebStorm. If you are willing to use WebStorm in your own computer, JetBrain provides students and teachers a free edition of WebStorm on their personal PC or Mac. Besides, if you are working on an open source project, you can also apply for a free edition of WebStorm. (Think about someday you become an open source guru, or start up your own business on Geovisualization, you might want to have a powerful yet free/open source IDE.)
