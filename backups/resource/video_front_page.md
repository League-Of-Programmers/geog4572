## Download Youtube Videos

Google doest not allow user use Chrome to download youtube video, but you can use Firefox to do that. To do that, you need to install an Youtube downloader extension, and follow the steps to download youtube videos. Such as a popular one is **[Download YouTube Videos as MP4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/?src=userprofile)** from [*ialc*](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/ialc/?src=api).

## convert video format

To make sure the video can be properly viewd in a html 5 page, you will need to use mp4 format. So, convert your video file if it is in avi or mpeg. To do that, you can use a freeware named qwinff, which you can download from [http://qwinff.github.io/](http://qwinff.github.io/).
