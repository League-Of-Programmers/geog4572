Hope you have been doing well in the final week! Please find the schedule and presentation sequence at http://jakobzhao.github.io/GeovisualAnalytics/project/flyer.html.

Based on the conversations with some of you, I would like to adjust the presenting time to 15~20 minutes (each team will have 15 to 20 minutes to present), and another 5 minutes for Q&A session.

I hope that each team can present the project in a way which the team members feel most comfortable. So, I do not want to make too many restrictive requirements. But to help you prepare the presentation, I expect the following items would provide you a presentation guideline, but your presentation is unnecessary to include all the listed items:

1.Team members

2.Adviser(s)

3.Background

4.Introduction

5.Related works

6.Data (describe how to get, clean, simplify and validate the data, esp. the geospatial data. What are the tools you have been used)

7.Method

   7.1 The specific web mapping architecture of the project and what are the open or proprietary components in each tier (e.g., github, rawgit, github page, bootstrap, leaflet, etc.)

   7.2 The unique mapping feature(s) of the project. For example, 3d, real-time, map storytelling, data interaction, spatialsankey, etc.

8.Tutorial + Demo

9.Design Scheme (sketch, layout, color palette, typography, Logo, icon etc. What are the designing tools you have been used.)

10.Results (describe some of the interesting results through exploring the geovisualization)

11.Future improvements (e.g. VR, animation)

12.Credits and acknowledgement
