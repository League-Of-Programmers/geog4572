# Naming Convention

In this course, you frequently use github for project management and geo-visualization. So, we carefully chose Github to undertake the above-mentioned tasks mainly because it provides a powerful function [`GitHub Page`](https://pages.github.com/) to immediately visualize a repository of web program to a web application, which can be accessed through an url in the format of `http[s]://[github-account-name].github.io/[repository-name]/[web-page].html`. Usually, a url is made up by lower-case characters, numbers, and symbols like `&`, `=`, `-`, `_`, or `?`. We rarely see upper case characters or other symbols in a url. Therefore, the following naming rules are recommended.

* use a combination of lower-case characters and/or numbers to name your github account name.
* use a combination of lower-case characters and/or numbers to name your github repository name. You can only name the main repository in the format of `[github-account-name].github.io`.
* name the main page of your repository as `index.html`. Because all browser will automatically visit `index.html` if you have not specified a page name under the domain name (e.g. www.www.www).
* If spacing is neccessary, dash/hyphen `-` is prioritized, or you can use underscore `_`. Please make sure no upper case character is used. For example, both `repo-name-proj` or `repo_name_proj` are fine. However, `repoNameProj` is not recommended.
